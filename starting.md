### Installation

**Method 1.** The easiest method to install VTEA is using the [FIJI updater](https://imagej.net/plugins/updater).  To install VTEA select the update site: "and check the update site: “Volumetric Tissue Exploration and Analysis.”

Unfortunately, the Renjin libraries "jars" that come with FIJI are our of date and interfere with plotting of heatmaps and violin plots in VTEA.  To remedie this the following jars need to removed.  This is not an ideal approach and [efforts](https://forum.image.sc/t/updating-version-of-renjin-supported-in-scijava/48497) are being made to bring FIJI up-to-date with the most recent releases of Renjin.

**Method 2.**  VTEA can also be run inside an IDE such as Netbeans.  The easiest approach is to clone the maven project from [github](https://github.com/icbm-iupui/volumetric-tissue-exploration-analysis).  

If there is any difficulty or concerns please feel free to submit an [issue](https://github.com/icbm-iupui/volumetric-tissue-exploration-analysis/issues), or contact [us](mailto:winfrees@iu.edu).
